# Git References

You can run something like `git log 1a410e` to look through your whole history, but you still have to remember that `1a410e` is the last commit in order to walk that history to find all those objects. You need a file in which you can store the SHA-1 value under a simple name so you can use that pointer rather than the raw SHA-1 value.

In Git, these are called "references" or "refs"; you can find the files that contain the SHA-1 values in the `.git/refs` directory. In the current project, this directory contains no files, but it does contain a simple structure:

	$ find .git/refs
	.git/refs
	.git/refs/heads
	.git/refs/tags
	$ find .git/refs -type f
	$

To create a new reference that will help you remember where your latest commit is, you can technically do something as simple as this:

	$ echo "1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9" > .git/refs/heads/master

Now, you can use the head reference you just created instead of the SHA-1 value in your Git commands:

	$ git log --pretty=oneline  master
	1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 third commit
	cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d second commit
	fdf4fc3344e67ab068f836878b6c4951e3b15f3d first commit

You aren’t encouraged to directly edit the reference files. Git provides a safer command to do this if you want to update a reference called `update-ref`:

	$ git update-ref refs/heads/master 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9

That’s basically what a branch in Git is: a simple pointer or reference to the head of a line of work. To create a branch back at the second commit, you can do this:

	$ git update-ref refs/heads/test cac0ca

Your branch will contain only work from that commit down:

	$ git log --pretty=oneline test
	cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d second commit
	fdf4fc3344e67ab068f836878b6c4951e3b15f3d first commit

Now, your Git database conceptually looks something like Figure 9-4.

Figure 9-4. Git directory objects with branch head references included.

When you run commands like `git branch (branchname)`, Git basically runs that `update-ref` command to add the SHA-1 of the last commit of the branch you’re on into whatever new reference you want to create.

## The HEAD

The question now is, when you run `git branch (branchname)`, how does Git know the SHA-1 of the last commit? The answer is the HEAD file. The HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the branch you’re currently on. By symbolic reference, I mean that unlike a normal reference, it doesn’t generally contain a SHA-1 value but rather a pointer to another reference. If you look at the file, you’ll normally see something like this:

	$ cat .git/HEAD
	ref: refs/heads/master

If you run `git checkout test`, Git updates the file to look like this:

	$ cat .git/HEAD
	ref: refs/heads/test

When you run `git commit`, it creates the commit object, specifying the parent of that commit object to be whatever SHA-1 value the reference in HEAD points to.

You can also manually edit this file, but again a safer command exists to do so: `symbolic-ref`. You can read the value of your HEAD via this command:

	$ git symbolic-ref HEAD
	refs/heads/master

You can also set the value of HEAD:

	$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/test
	$ cat .git/HEAD
	ref: refs/heads/test

You can’t set a symbolic reference outside of the refs style:

	$ git symbolic-ref HEAD test
	fatal: Refusing to point HEAD outside of refs/

## Tags

You’ve just gone over Git’s three main object types, but there is a fourth. The tag object is very much like a commit object — it contains a tagger, a date, a message, and a pointer. The main difference is that a tag object points to a commit rather than a tree. It’s like a branch reference, but it never moves — it always points to the same commit but gives it a friendlier name.

As discussed in Chapter 2, there are two types of tags: annotated and lightweight. You can make a lightweight tag by running something like this:

	$ git update-ref refs/tags/v1.0 cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d

That is all a lightweight tag is — a branch that never moves. An annotated tag is more complex, however. If you create an annotated tag, Git creates a tag object and then writes a reference to point to it rather than directly to the commit. You can see this by creating an annotated tag (`-a` specifies that it’s an annotated tag):

	$ git tag -a v1.1 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 -m 'test tag'

Here’s the object SHA-1 value it created:

	$ cat .git/refs/tags/v1.1
	9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2

Now, run the `cat-file` command on that SHA-1 value:

	$ git cat-file -p 9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2
	object 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9
	type commit
	tag v1.1
	tagger Scott Chacon <schacon@gmail.com> Sat May 23 16:48:58 2009 -0700

	test tag

Notice that the object entry points to the commit SHA-1 value that you tagged. Also notice that it doesn’t need to point to a commit; you can tag any Git object. In the Git source code, for example, the maintainer has added their GPG public key as a blob object and then tagged it. You can view the public key by running

	$ git cat-file blob junio-gpg-pub

in the Git source code repository. The Linux kernel repository also has a non-commit-pointing tag object — the first tag created points to the initial tree of the import of the source code.

## Remotes

The third type of reference that you’ll see is a remote reference. If you add a remote and push to it, Git stores the value you last pushed to that remote for each branch in the `refs/remotes` directory. For instance, you can add a remote called `origin` and push your `master` branch to it:

	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
	$ git push origin master
	Counting objects: 11, done.
	Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 716 bytes, done.
	Total 7 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 1)
	To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
	   a11bef0..ca82a6d  master -> master

Then, you can see what the `master` branch on the `origin` remote was the last time you communicated with the server, by checking the `refs/remotes/origin/master` file:

	$ cat .git/refs/remotes/origin/master
	ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949

Remote references differ from branches (`refs/heads` references) mainly in that they can’t be checked out. Git moves them around as bookmarks to the last known state of where those branches were on those servers.
