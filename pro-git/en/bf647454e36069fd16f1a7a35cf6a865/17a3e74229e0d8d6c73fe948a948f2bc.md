# Getting Help

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

	$ git help <verb>
	$ git <verb> --help
	$ man git-<verb>

For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running

	$ git help config

These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline.
If the manpages and this book arenâ€™t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the `#git` or `#github` channel on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.
