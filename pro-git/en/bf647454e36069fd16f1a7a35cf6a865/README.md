# Getting Started

This chapter will be about getting started with Git.  We will begin at the beginning by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it setup to start working with.  At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all setup to do so.
