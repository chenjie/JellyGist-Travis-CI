# Setting Up the Server

Let’s walk through setting up SSH access on the server side. In this example, you’ll use the `authorized_keys` method for authenticating your users. We also assume you’re running a standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu. First, you create a 'git' user and a `.ssh` directory for that user.

	$ sudo adduser git
	$ su git
	$ cd
	$ mkdir .ssh

Next, you need to add some developer SSH public keys to the `authorized_keys` file for that user. Let’s assume you’ve received a few keys by e-mail and saved them to temporary files. Again, the public keys look something like this:

	$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub
	ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCB007n/ww+ouN4gSLKssMxXnBOvf9LGt4L
	ojG6rs6hPB09j9R/T17/x4lhJA0F3FR1rP6kYBRsWj2aThGw6HXLm9/5zytK6Ztg3RPKK+4k
	Yjh6541NYsnEAZuXz0jTTyAUfrtU3Z5E003C4oxOj6H0rfIF1kKI9MAQLMdpGW1GYEIgS9Ez
	Sdfd8AcCIicTDWbqLAcU4UpkaX8KyGlLwsNuuGztobF8m72ALC/nLF6JLtPofwFBlgc+myiv
	O7TCUSBdLQlgMVOFq1I2uPWQOkOWQAHukEOmfjy2jctxSDBQ220ymjaNsHT4kgtZg2AYYgPq
	dAv8JggJICUvax2T9va5 gsg-keypair

You just append them to your `authorized_keys` file:

	$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.josie.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.jessica.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now, you can set up an empty repository for them by running `git init` with the `--bare` option, which initializes the repository without a working directory:

	$ cd /opt/git
	$ mkdir project.git
	$ cd project.git
	$ git --bare init

Then, John, Josie, or Jessica can push the first version of their project into that repository by adding it as a remote and pushing up a branch. Note that someone must shell onto the machine and create a bare repository every time you want to add a project. Let’s use `gitserver` as the hostname of the server on which you’ve set up your 'git' user and repository. If you’re running it internally, and you set up DNS for `gitserver` to point to that server, then you can use the commands pretty much as is:

	# on Johns computer
	$ cd myproject
	$ git init
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
	$ git remote add origin git@gitserver:/opt/git/project.git
	$ git push origin master

At this point, the others can clone it down and push changes back up just as easily:

	$ git clone git@gitserver:/opt/git/project.git
	$ cd project
	$ vim README
	$ git commit -am 'fix for the README file'
	$ git push origin master

With this method, you can quickly get a read/write Git server up and running for a handful of developers.

As an extra precaution, you can easily restrict the 'git' user to only doing Git activities with a limited shell tool called `git-shell` that comes with Git. If you set this as your 'git' user’s login shell, then the 'git' user can’t have normal shell access to your server. To use this, specify `git-shell` instead of bash or csh for your user’s login shell. To do so, you’ll likely have to edit your `/etc/passwd` file:

	$ sudo vim /etc/passwd

At the bottom, you should find a line that looks something like this:

	git:x:1000:1000::/home/git:/bin/sh

Change `/bin/sh` to `/usr/bin/git-shell` (or run `which git-shell` to see where it’s installed). The line should look something like this:

	git:x:1000:1000::/home/git:/usr/bin/git-shell

Now, the 'git' user can only use the SSH connection to push and pull Git repositories and can’t shell onto the machine. If you try, you’ll see a login rejection like this:

	$ ssh git@gitserver
	fatal: What do you think I am? A shell?
	Connection to gitserver closed.
